#  Coffee Shop Sales Analysis Dashboard
# Problem Statement:
Marvin Coffee Shop has been operating for several years, serving a growing number of customers daily. However, the management faces challenges in understanding sales trends, customer preferences, and product performance. The lack of structured data analysis makes it difficult to identify which products are most profitable, which days or times experience peak sales, and how inventory and staffing can be optimized. This results in missed opportunities for increasing revenue, improving customer satisfaction, and streamlining operations. Therefore, there is a need to conduct a detailed data analysis of sales, products, and customer behavior to provide actionable insights that will support informed business decisions and enhance overall performance.
